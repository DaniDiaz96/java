# Charlene Coffee Corner

A project that simulate a coffee shop

## Installing

How you run this code is up to you, but usually you would start by using an IDE like NetBeans, Intellij IDEA, or Eclipse.

The Maven dependencies may lag behind the official releases a bit.

If you notice some problems with this setup, please open an issue.

### A couple of Maven commands

Once you have configured the project in your IDE you can build it from there. However if you prefer you can use maven from the command line. In that case you could be interested in this short list of commands:

* `mvn compile`: it will just compile the code of the application and tell you if there are errors
* `mvn test`: it will compile the code of the application and the tests.
* `mvn install`: it will do everything `mvn test` does and then if everything looks file it will install the library or the application into your local maven repository (typically under <USER FOLDER>/.m2). In this way you could use this library from other projects you want to build on the same machine

If you need more information please take a look at this [quick tutorial](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html).
